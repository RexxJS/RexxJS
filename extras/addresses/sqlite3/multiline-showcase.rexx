// Showcase 1: Complex table with constraints
ADDRESS sqlite3
<<CREATE_TABLE
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL,
  salary REAL CHECK(salary > 0),
  hire_date TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE_TABLE

ADDRESS EXPECTATIONS
"{RESULT.success} should equal true"
"{RESULT.operation} should equal 'CREATE_TABLE'"

SAY "‚úì Complex table created"

// Showcase 2: Batch insert with multiline VALUES
ADDRESS sqlite3
<<INSERT_VALUES
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
  ('Alice Johnson', 'Engineering', 75000),
  ('Bob Smith', 'Sales', 55000),
  ('Carol Davis', 'Engineering', 80000),
  ('David Wilson', 'Marketing', 50000);

SAY "‚úì Batch insert: " || RESULT.rowsAffected || " employees added"

// Showcase 3: Complex query with aggregation
ADDRESS sqlite3
<<AGGREGATE_QUERY
SELECT
  department,
  COUNT(*) as employee_count,
  AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
  MAX(salary) as max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

  SAY "    üí∞ Avg Salary: $" || dept.avg_salary

// Showcase 5: Conditional query with complex WHERE
ADDRESS sqlite3
<<WHERE_QUERY
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000
  AND department IN ('Engineering', 'Sales')

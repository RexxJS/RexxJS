/* Test Secret Manager
 *
 * This script demonstrates Secret Manager operations:
 *   - Creating and managing secrets
 *   - Adding secret versions
 *   - Accessing secret values
 *   - Managing secret lifecycle
 *
 * Required APIs:
 *   - secretmanager.googleapis.com
 *
 * Required Permissions:
 *   - secretmanager.secrets.create
 *   - secretmanager.secrets.delete
 *   - secretmanager.secrets.get
 *   - secretmanager.secrets.list
 *   - secretmanager.versions.add
 *   - secretmanager.versions.access
 *   - secretmanager.versions.destroy
 *   - secretmanager.versions.list
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE:
 *   Secrets are encrypted at rest with AES-256 or better
 *   Use IAM to control who can access secrets
 *   Audit secret access in Cloud Logging

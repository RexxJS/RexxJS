SAY "=== Summary ==="
SAY ""
SAY "✓ All 30 GCP handlers now support variable interpolation"
SAY "✓ Interpolation uses RexxJS global interpolation-config.js"
SAY "✓ Variable pool is read-only (frozen) in handlers"
SAY "✓ Supports: handlebars {{var}}, shell \${var}, batch %var%, custom patterns"
SAY ""
SAY "Benefits:"
SAY "  • DRY: Define configuration once, reuse in commands"
SAY "  • Environment parity: Same templates, different values"
SAY "  • Type safety: Variables validated at REXX level"
SAY "  • Consistency: All handlers use same interpolation system"

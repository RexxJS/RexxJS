# Renderer TODO List

This document lists functions in the RexxJS codebase that could benefit from a visual renderer in the REPL.

## extras/functions

- **diff**: Could render a side-by-side or inline diff view.
- **excel**: Could render spreadsheet data as an interactive table.
- **graphviz**: (This is the focus of the current task) Renders graphs.
- **numpy-inspired**: Could render matrices and arrays as tables or heatmaps.
- **r-inspired**: Could render data frames as tables and generate plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
- **scipy-inspired**: Could render scientific plots.
- **sympy-inspired**: Could render mathematical equations using MathJax or KaTeX.

## core/src

- **json-functions**: Could render JSON data as an interactive, collapsible tree view.
- **statistics-functions**: Could render statistical summaries as tables or charts (e.g., box plots, histograms).
- **http-functions**: Could render JSON or HTML responses. JSON could be a tree view, and HTML could be rendered in a sandboxed iframe.
- **array-functions**: Could render arrays as tables.

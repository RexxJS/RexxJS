# Human Actions Required

## ✅ ALL COMPLETE - Cloud Run Integration Working!

**Test Results**: All passing!

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/paul/scm/RexxJS/tribal-quasar-473615-a4-635d7dd51d14.json"
node core/src/rexxjs-cli.js extras/addresses/provisioning-and-orchestration/examples/gcp/test-cloudrun-hello.rexx
```

**What Works**:
- ✅ Deploy Cloud Run services from RexxJS
- ✅ Extract service URL from gcloud output
- ✅ Test service with HTTP_GET
- ✅ Validate response content
- ✅ Clean up (delete service)
- ✅ HTTP functions now return structured objects {status, body, headers, ok}

**Changes Made**:
1. Installed gcloud CLI
2. Granted service account permissions: Cloud Run Admin + Service Account User
3. Updated HTTP_GET/POST/PUT/DELETE to return objects instead of strings
4. Added RUN DELETE command to Cloud Run handler
5. Fixed {variable} interpolation in test script

**Cost**: $0.00 - fully within free tier

# What This Repository Contains

This is a **REXX interpreter and RPC framework** implemented in JavaScript, designed to run both in Node.js and browsers with comprehensive cross-application communication capabilities.

## Core Components

### REXX Language Interpreter (`src/interpreter.js`)
- Complete REXX language implementation with modern extensions
- Supports classic REXX syntax: `SAY`, `LET`, `DO...END`, `IF...THEN...ELSE`, `SELECT...WHEN`
- Advanced control structures: `DO OVER` for iteration, `INTERPRET` for dynamic code execution
- Function library system with 200+ built-in functions across multiple domains

### Environment Detection & Awareness

The interpreter automatically detects its execution environmentâ€”whether it's running in a standard
Node.js process, as a standalone executable created by `pkg`, or within a web browser. This runtime
context is exposed in two ways: globally to other JavaScript modules via the `REXX_ENVIRONMENT`
object, and directly to REXX scripts through special `RUNTIME.` stem variables (e.g., `RUNTIME.TYPE`,
`RUNTIME.IS_PKG`, `RUNTIME.HAS_DOM`). This powerful feature allows both the core system and user
scripts to implement conditional logic that adapts to the capabilities of the host environment, such
as accessing the file system in Node.js or manipulating the DOM in a browser.

## CLI & Distribution

- **./rexx** - Standalone binary (49MB, no Node.js required) created via `create-pkg-binary.js`
- **node core/src/cli.js** - Node.js CLI for development (requires Node.js installation)  
- **./rexxt** - Test runner (via src/test-interpreter.js) with TUI experience 

### Function Libraries (core `src/` and modular `extras/functions/`)
- **Core functions**: String processing, JSON/Web, security, validation (in `src/`)
- **HTTP functions**: RESTful API integration with `HTTP_GET`, `HTTP_POST`, `HTTP_PUT`, `HTTP_DELETE` returning structured `{status, body, headers, ok}` objects (in `src/`)
- **R-style functions**: Statistical computing (data frames, factors, mathematical operations) - relocated to `extras/functions/r-inspired/`
- **SciPy-style functions**: Scientific computing (interpolation, signal processing) - relocated to `extras/functions/scipy/`
- **Excel functions**: Spreadsheet operations (VLOOKUP, statistical functions) - relocated to `extras/functions/excel/`
- **Modular design**: Function libraries loaded on-demand via REXX `REQUIRE` statements

### Operations vs Functions Architecture
RexxJS distinguishes between two types of callable code:
- **Operations** (imperative commands without parentheses): Side-effect actions like `SERVE_GUEST guest="alice"` or `CLEAN_BATHHOUSE area="lobby"`
  - Receive parameters as named params object directly
  - Used for state-changing commands and imperative workflows
  - Can be called from REQUIRE'd libraries alongside functions
- **Functions** (expressions with parentheses): Pure/query operations like `COUNT_TOKENS()` or `IDENTIFY_SPIRIT(description="muddy")`
  - Support both positional (`SUBSTR("hello", 2, 3)`) and named parameters (`SUBSTR(start=2, length=3)`)
  - Parameters converted via parameter-converter for flexibility
  - Work in all contexts: assignments, expressions, pipe operators
- **REQUIRE system**: Libraries export both functions and operations, automatically loaded and prefixed via `REQUIRE "lib" AS prefix_(.*)`

### Function Execution Priority
When a function is called, the interpreter resolves it in this order:
1. **Built-in REXX functions** (LENGTH, SUBSTR, POS, etc.) - Always available regardless of ADDRESS context
2. **External functions** from REQUIRE'd libraries
3. **ADDRESS handler custom methods** - Only checked if not a built-in function
4. **Browser functions** (executeBrowserStringFunction)
5. **RPC/fallback** handler

This ensures standard REXX functions always work, while allowing ADDRESS handlers to define custom methods that don't conflict with built-ins. DOM functions use `DOM_` prefix (`DOM_QUERY`, `DOM_CLICK`, etc.) to avoid naming conflicts.

### ADDRESS mechanism
- **Cross-Application Communication** is one way of looking at it
- **Alien parsable/interpretable language** (Sql, bash, english assertion grammar, others)
- **implementations** can modify RC and RESULT vars (the latter a dict if needed)
- **SQL**: SQLite database operations
- **SYSTEM**: OS-level shell command execution (`ADDRESS SYSTEM "ls -la"`, `ADDRESS SYSTEM "cat > file.txt <<'EOF' ... EOF"`)
- **Assertions**: not just for the build in test framework
- **Mock testing**: Comprehensive test framework (`core/tests/mock-address.js`)
- **HEREDOC with interpolation**: `<<SQL` supports variable interpolation with configurable patterns (`{{var}}`, `${var}`, custom)
- **HEREDOC JSON auto-parsing**: `LET config = <<JSON` automatically parses to JavaScript objects
- Supports both traditional command strings (`"CREATE TABLE users"`) and modern method calls (`execute sql="CREATE TABLE users"`)

### Provisioning & Orchestration (`extras/addresses/provisioning-and-orchestration/`)

### Modern Extensions
- Array/object manipulation with JSON integration
- Functional programming constructs (`MAP`, `FILTER`, `REDUCE`)
- Async/await patterns for browser operations
- Real-time progress monitoring with `CHECKPOINT()`
- Configurable string interpolation patterns (handlebars `{{var}}`, shell `${var}`, batch `%var%`, custom delimiters)

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular design:
- **Parser** (`src/parser.js`): Converts REXX source to executable commands
- **Interpreter** (`src/interpreter.js`): Executes parsed commands with full language support
- **Function Libraries**: Domain-specific functionality in separate modules
- **ADDRESS Targets**: Plugin architecture for external system integration
- **Web Framework**: Browser-specific enhancements and RPC capabilities

### Module Loading Support Matrix

RexxJS supports 6 different module loading combinations across 3 execution environments and 2 bundle modes:

| Environment | Bundled Modules (.bundle.js) | Unbundled Modules (.js) |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Node.js** | âœ… All dependencies included via webpack<br>Loaded from registry or local | âœ… Dependencies resolved from unpkg.com<br>Cached to `.rexxjs-modules/`<br>Uses Node.js scoped `require()` |
| **pkg executable** | âœ… system-address.bundle.js embedded<br>Other bundles from registry | âœ… Dependencies resolved from unpkg.com<br>Cached to `.rexxjs-modules/`<br>Works without node_modules |
| **Browser/DOM** | âœ… All dependencies included via webpack<br>Loaded from registry | âœ… Dependencies resolved from unpkg.com<br>Runtime resolution only (no FS cache) |

**Key Design Principles:**
- **No fallbacks**: Users explicitly choose bundled vs unbundled via REQUIRE statement
  - `REQUIRE "registry:org.rexxjs/jq-address.bundle"` - bundled version
  - `REQUIRE "registry:org.rexxjs/jq-address"` - unbundled version
- **Universal dependency source**: All npm dependencies fetched from unpkg.com
- **Separate distributions**:
  - Bundled modules published to GitHub Pages registry (../dist/ repo)
  - Unbundled modules available locally (dist/) or from registry

## Use Cases

1. **Scientific Computing**: R/SciPy-compatible functions for data analysis
2. **Web Automation**: Cross-iframe scripting and browser control
3. **Database Operations**: SQL integration with full CRUD capabilities (SQLite3)
4. **HTTP API Integration**: RESTful service communication with `HTTP_GET`, `HTTP_POST`, `HTTP_PUT`, `HTTP_DELETE` functions
5. **System Administration**: OS command execution and file operations
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive mock frameworks for ADDRESS-based applications
7. **Infrastructure Automation**: VM/container provisioning with QEMU, VirtualBox, Docker, Podman
   - CI/CD test environments with automatic VM creation and teardown
   - Multi-platform testing across different OS versions
   - Development environment provisioning and configuration
   - Container-based microservice orchestration
8. **Cloud Orchestration**: Google Cloud Platform service automation and data workflows
   - Google Sheets as database with SQL-like operations
   - Cross-service data pipelines (Sheets â†’ BigQuery â†’ Firestore â†’ Pub/Sub)
   - Serverless function deployment and management
   - Real-time analytics and machine learning pipelines
   - Business intelligence dashboard automation

## Development Guidelines

### For LLM Assistants (`CLAUDE.md`)
- **Testing Requirements**: All work must have `npm test` passing at 100% before completion
- **Web/DOM Work**: Must also have `npm run test:web` passing for browser-related features  
- **Test Execution**: Use `@scratch_test.sh` instructions for all test invocations
- **Playwright Tests**: Prefix with `PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never` to prevent browser windows
- **No Fallback Logic**: Avoid implementing "fallback" patterns - ask for explicit guidance instead

This repository provides a complete REXX environment with modern extensions, making it suitable for everything from simple scripting to complex distributed applications running in browsers or Node.js.

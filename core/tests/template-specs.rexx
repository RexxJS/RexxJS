/* 
=== REXXT BEST PRACTICES TEMPLATE ===

1. Use #!/usr/bin/env ./rexxt shebang
2. Add @test-tags and @description comments
3. REQUIRE "./src/expectations-address.js"
4. Use descriptive suite names with START_DESCRIBE/END_DESCRIBE
5. Use descriptive test names with START_TEST
6. Use ADDRESS EXPECTATIONS with clear assertions
7. Always call PASS or FAIL to conclude tests
8. Use meaningful variable names
9. Group related tests in describe blocks
10. Add setup SAY statements for visibility

This pattern gives you:
‚úÖ Detailed test output with suite/test/expectation counts
‚úÖ Individual test tracking and pass/fail status
‚úÖ Proper hierarchical test structure
‚úÖ JSON output for test navigation
‚úÖ Clean, readable test organization
